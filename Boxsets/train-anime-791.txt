Thanks a lot.\When I first arrived in Tokyo,\I didn't know whether I'd be able to make it or not.\Could I get a job, would I be Shoji's girl forever?\I had a mountain of anxieties.\Your bag's all clothes. Are you a peddler?\What's your choice, ma'am?\But as strange as it seems, response:	I had absolutely no qualms about moving in with you, Nana.
