Transmitter Receiver Coil Electric current Magnet Paper cone (Diaphragm)\This causes an electric current. Transmitter Receiver Coil Electric current Magnet Paper cone (Diaphragm)\In other words, it's changed the sound into an electric signal. Transmitter Receiver Coil Electric current Magnet Paper cone (Diaphragm)\Just like the electromagnetic induction we did with Mr. Faraday? Transmitter Receiver Coil Electric current Magnet Paper cone (Diaphragm)\Yes. Then the coil on the receiver's end reacts to the electric signal, Transmitter Receiver Coil Electric current Magnet Paper cone (Diaphragm)\and the diaphragm vibrates and creates sound. Transmitter Receiver Coil Electric current Magnet Paper cone (Diaphragm)\Sending your voice with electricity... What a great idea!\Bell wanted to find a way to help deaf people hear. That's how he thought of it. response:	So science can give form to people's feelings too, huh?
